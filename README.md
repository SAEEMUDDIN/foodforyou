The diagram above can be seen that we use controller to accept input from the customer class which allows the user to input their name, address, and phone number. Once the details are retrieved, it will convert its command to the model to insert the customers data into the system database. Then the menu will be displayed by using view. The user will once again choose the food and the quantity of the products and the model will receive their input and will be sent onto databases.

Once all the data are received, the system will calculate the total price of the food of the customer ordered. It will then display the total amount of customer need to pay. The controller will take part of the process and view system will display back to the customer. The system will process the payment and display their receipt and order ID to track their order status. Once the order has been completed, it will delete the data in database system.
